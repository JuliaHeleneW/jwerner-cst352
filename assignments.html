        <ul>Links to my assignments:
        <li><a href="assignments/assignment3/index.php?displayForm=on">Assignment 3: I learned to create a php form on my own, using datatypes we haven't used in class, like text area. I also learned to connect the input data with the output and to put it on the right place, especially by not forgetting global variables, which have become very important for the assignment. I learned to create something new with pure form data, which helped me recognize the endless opportunities I have with forms. I also improved my HTML and CSS skills, especially for HTML forms, and using the style tag for CSS connected with PHP.</a></li>
        <li><a href="assignments/assignment4/index.php">Assignment 4: A page of 10 SELECT reports. I learned how to use the SELECT statement to display specific content.</a></li></ul>
